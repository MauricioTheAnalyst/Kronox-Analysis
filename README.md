Description:

My family owns a small business in Durango, Mexico named Financial Servicies Kronox. The business primarily gets its income through interest generated from financing loans to various clients. The following is a general data analysis performed with the purpose of helping my family visualize business's history as well as make more well informed data-driven business decisions.

1.Gather and Understand Data:

During this stage of the process, I worked closely with the company accountant, who provided me with 4 different types of finanical statements to analyze. These statements included: Earnings Reports, Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Expense Sheets since the year 2018. In order to understand how income flows between the accounts, established and maintained productive communication with company accountant.

Below is an image of a sample balance sheet (for January 2022) so that readers may be able to understand how I transformed the data from the balance sheet to excel. I have also attatched all four financial statements for the same month underneath said image.
